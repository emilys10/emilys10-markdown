#Dog Lives Matter Too
*Dogs are not just a material object that can be thrown away when you become bored or is no longer a cute puppy. They have feelings and **deserve a good quality life** like every other living thing on the planet*
##Alternatives To Turning Your Beloved Pets To The Streets
*Giving your pet to a family member or family friend
*Giving your pet to a local non-kill shelter
*Advertise them on social media and see if friends of friends need or want a pet
